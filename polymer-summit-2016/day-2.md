# Polymer Summit 2016 - Day 2

## What's New in Polymer Tools - Justin Fagnani

- Polymer tools are not specific for the library but they are tools for **Web Components**
- **PRPL** Push Render Pre-cache Lazy-load
- Polidev tool: to see which type of features cost the most.
- Polyperf tool: to analyse the performance of a component.
- How-to reduce the cost of an element:
  - Remove components that do something simple we can quickly replicate.
  - Move the creation of certain details for when its needed.
  - Use CSS instead of toggling classes via js.
  - Reduce the use of default values for the properties.
  - Defer work until after render. ```Polymer.renderStatus.afterNextRender()```.
